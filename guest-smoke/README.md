This is an implementation of Guestbook, from kubernetes

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/master/examples/guestbook

Which has been modified.

- more hackable
- all dockerfiles are in this repo
- more error reporting (i.e. for missing envs)

In the future, we will have

- load testing on multiple servers
- lots of guests
- other additions to guestbook
